                        The girl in this art piece is called Rabina. She is from a small village in northern Tanzania.
                        Marcel’s friend & photographer Lior found this village while covering the growing concerns of
                        the water crisis across Africa. In Rabina’s village, people dig small holes in a dry river bank
                        to find water. <br> Marcel van Luit was inspired by her hope when he created this artwork. 10%
                        of the
                        sales of this piece are going to a school fund for Raina.

                        This piece is made by the Palestinian graphic artist Jamal Masarwa who expresses his freedom
                        through his artistic journey and the use of Arabic Calligraphy.
                        "art is my free space to express my thoughts and dreams and everything inside me. It’s an area
                        of ​​freedom where no one can tell me what’s right or what’s wrong; no one can put limits to my
                        creative process. <br> Art is ​​freed of the considerations of right and wrong, and it allows me
                        to glorify the Arabic language." said Masarwa

                    <p>
                        Van Gogh painted Café Terrace at Night in Arles, France, in mid-September 1888. The painting is
                        not signed, but described and mentioned by the artist in three letters.
                        This is the first painting in which he used starry backgrounds; he went on to paint star-filled
                        skies in Starry Night Over the Rhône , and the better known The Starry Night a year later.

                        of Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten.The work is believed to have been crafted in <b>1345 B.C.</b> by
                        Thutmose because it was found in his workshop in Amarna, Egypt. It is one of the most copied
                        works of ancient Egypt. Nefertiti has become one of the most famous women of the ancient world
                        and an icon of feminine beauty.
